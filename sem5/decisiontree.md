- x0 and x1
- plot as dots
- not linearly separable
- binary tree that recursively splits the dataset, till pure leaf nodes, i.e all points in the leaf node belong to the same class
- watch [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZVR2Way4nwQ)
- how to decide optimal splits?
- information theory, choose split that maximizes information gain
- entropy : measure of information contained in a state
- IG = E(parent) - weighted avg of E(children)
- Does not backtrack, greedy problem
- doesn't guarantee optimal solution
