# Projects

- [Matching Networks for One Shot Learning implementation](./mini_projects/MatchingNetworks)
    - Trained and Tested for 5 way 1 shot 1 query, 69% accuracy on test set (Omniglot)
- [Siamese Networks for One Shot Learning implementation](mini_projects/Siamese_Network_Omniglot)
- [Attempt at Gru based quote generator(specifically Carl Sagan)](./mini_projects/GruSaganQuote)
    - this is a bit of a disaster though, I only trained on 1000 quotes, and the model does not generate good sentences, it doesn't know grammar or words, since I used a character prediction and not word prediction, given the size of the dataset. Helped in understanding how to use Gru.
- [Perceptron from Scratch](fromScratch/Perceptron.ipynb)
