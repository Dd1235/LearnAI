- Usually three servers, dev, uat and prod 
- Dev is for development, UAT is for user acceptance testing, and prod is for production

- Overfitting: low bias high variance
- Underfitting: high bias low variance
- Bias is about mistakes, Variance is about sensitivity to fluctuations in the training set.
- Bias-Variance Tradeoff: the balance between bias and variance to minimize total error.
